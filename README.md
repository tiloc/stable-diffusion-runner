A few simple scripts to make running Stable Diffusion locally on an M1 Mac easier

Requires the "Pashua" tool be in the Application folder.
Build it from this branch: https://github.com/jkeller13/Pashua/tree/support-arm64

Requires a stable diffusion installation as described here: https://weirdwonderfulai.art/resources/running-stable-diffusion-on-m1-m2-mac

Located at ../stable-diffusion

Will write output to ../stable-diffusion-output
